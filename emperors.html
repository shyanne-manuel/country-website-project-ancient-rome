                        <p>He was the emperor during all of Jesus's ministry and during the first few years of the existence of the Christian congregation. At Jesus' trial, it was to Tiberius that the Jews were referring when they shouted: "If you [Pilate] release this man, you are not a friend of Ceasar... We have no king but Ceasar" (John 19:12,15) </p>

                        <p>He is named twice in the book of Acts. As foretold by the Christian prophet Agabus, “a great famine,” dated about 46 C.E., came “on the entire inhabited earth... in the time of Claudius.” Moreover, in 49 or early 50 C.E., Claudius “ordered all the Jews to leave Rome,” a decree that prompted Aquila and Priscilla to move to Corinth, where they met the apostle Paul. - Acts 11:28; 18:1,2</p>

                        <p>He was the Caesar to whom Paul appealed. (Acts 25:11) It is said that this emperor later blamed the Christians for the fire that destroyed much of Rome in about 64 C.E. Soon thereafter, in about 65 C.E., the apostle Paul suffered his second imprisonment in Rome and was executed.</p>
